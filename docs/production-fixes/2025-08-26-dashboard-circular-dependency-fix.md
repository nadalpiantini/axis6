# Dashboard Circular Dependency Fix
**Date**: 2025-08-26  
**Issue**: Critical JavaScript runtime error in production  
**Error**: `Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'V' before initialization`

## Problem Summary
Production dashboard was crashing immediately on load with a circular dependency error. The minified variable 'V' couldn't be accessed before initialization, causing complete dashboard failure.

## Root Cause
Circular dependency in `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` where:
- `axisToggleHandlers` (useMemo) was trying to reference `handleToggleAxis`
- `handleToggleAxis` (useCallback) hadn't been initialized yet
- Hook ordering violation caused initialization failure

## Solution Applied
Complete rewrite of dashboard component with proper hook ordering:

### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
const axisToggleHandlers = useMemo(() => {
  const handlers = new Map()
  axes.forEach(axis => {
    handlers.set(axis.id, () => handleToggleAxis(axis.id))
  })
  return handlers
}, [axes, handleToggleAxis]) // ❌ handleToggleAxis not yet defined

const handleToggleAxis = useCallback((axisId: string) => {
  // implementation
}, [dependencies])
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
const handleToggleAxis = useCallback((axisId: string) => {
  // implementation  
}, [dependencies])

// Removed memoized handlers, using inline callbacks instead:
<HexagonAxis 
  onToggle={() => handleToggleAxis(axis.id)} // ✅ Direct inline callback
/>
```

## Files Modified
- `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite with fixed hook ordering

## Verification
- ✅ No JavaScript errors on landing page
- ✅ No JavaScript errors on dashboard  
- ✅ Successfully deployed to production
- ✅ Verified with Playwright E2E test (`dashboard-error-check.spec.ts`)

## Deployment
- Commit: `b8d8a72` - "fix: Resolve dashboard circular dependency causing 'Cannot access V before initialization' error"
- Deployed: 2025-08-26 19:27 UTC
- Status: ✅ Resolved

## Lessons Learned
1. Hook dependencies must be defined before being referenced
2. Memoization can introduce circular dependencies if not carefully ordered
3. Inline callbacks can be simpler and safer than pre-memoized handlers
4. Always test for JavaScript runtime errors in production builds

## Monitoring
Added `dashboard-error-check.spec.ts` test to catch JavaScript initialization errors in CI/CD pipeline.
