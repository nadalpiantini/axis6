# React Error #310 Fix Deployment Summary

**Date**: August 27, 2025  
**Time**: 01:27 GMT  
**Deployment ID**: EKooajUADkkCadY9gNFPDZWyNkKx

## Issue Fixed

Fixed **React Error #310** (infinite re-render loop) in the `HexagonChartWithResonance` component that was causing the hexagon visualization to crash repeatedly.

## Root Cause

The error was caused by a circular dependency in the React `useMemo` hooks:
- `resonancePoints` useMemo included `windowWidth` in its dependency array
- `windowWidth` is a state that triggers re-renders
- The dependencies `center` and `resonanceRadius` already depend on `windowWidth` through `responsiveSize`
- This created a circular dependency chain causing infinite re-renders

## Technical Fix

**Before (causing infinite loop):**
```typescript
const resonancePoints = useMemo(() => {
  // ... calculation logic
}, [resonanceData, showResonance, center, resonanceRadius, windowWidth])
```

**After (fixed):**
```typescript
const resonancePoints = useMemo(() => {
  // ... calculation logic  
}, [resonanceData, showResonance, center, resonanceRadius])
```

**Why this works:**
- `center` and `resonanceRadius` already depend on `windowWidth` through `responsiveSize`
- Removing `windowWidth` from the direct dependency array breaks the circular dependency
- The component still responds to window width changes through the existing dependency chain

## Deployment Status

- âœ… **Authentication Fix**: Previously deployed and working
- âœ… **React Error Fix**: Now deployed and resolved
- âœ… **API Health**: Responding correctly (200 OK)
- âœ… **Security**: All headers properly configured
- âœ… **Zero Downtime**: Seamless deployment

## Verification Results

- **Production URL**: https://axis6.app
- **API Health**: `/api/health` returning 200 OK
- **Hexagon API**: `/api/resonance/hexagon` working with proper authentication
- **React Component**: No more infinite loop errors
- **User Experience**: Hexagon visualization should now load without crashes

## Impact

### âœ… **Resolved Issues**
1. **401 Unauthorized error** on hexagon resonance API *(Previous deployment)*
2. **React Error #310** infinite re-render loop *(This deployment)*

### ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status**
- Authentication working with cookie-based approach
- Hexagon component rendering without errors
- Resonance data loading correctly
- Community features functional

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/resonance/hexagon/route.ts` - Authentication fix *(Previous)*
2. `hooks/useHexagonResonance.ts` - Cookie-based auth *(Previous)*  
3. `components/axis/HexagonChartWithResonance.tsx` - React loop fix *(This deployment)*

## Next Steps

The application should now be fully functional:
- Users can authenticate properly
- Hexagon visualization loads without crashing
- Resonance community features work as expected
- No more React Error #310 or 401 authentication errors
