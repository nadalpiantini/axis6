# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED IMMEDIATELY

## CRITICAL SITUATION
- **Infinite retry loop is STILL RUNNING in production**
- Browser making thousands of requests per second
- Server is being flooded with 500 error requests
- This will crash your server if not stopped NOW

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. DEPLOY FRONTEND FIXES (RIGHT NOW)
```bash
# In your project directory, run:
npm run build
npm run deploy
# OR if using Vercel:
vercel --prod
```

### 2. APPLY SQL FIX IN SUPABASE (IMMEDIATELY AFTER)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nvpnhqhjttgwfwvkgmpk/sql/new
2. Copy ALL contents from `EMERGENCY_CHAT_500_ERROR_FIX.sql`
3. Paste and click **RUN**

## WHAT THE FIXES DO

**Frontend Fixes (stops infinite loop)**:
- `retry: false` in React Query
- Circuit breaker to reload page after 3 errors
- Better error handling

**SQL Fix (resolves 500 errors)**:

- Corrects foreign key relationships
- Adds missing columns

## TIME CRITICAL

The infinite loop is creating exponential load on your server. Deploy these fixes NOW.

## Verification Steps
